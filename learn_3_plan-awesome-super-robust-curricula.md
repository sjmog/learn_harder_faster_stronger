ANALYSING AND BUILDING CURRICULA USING TAXONOMY TABLES
===

State of Minnesota 1998: “[students will] write original compositions that analyse patterns and relationships of ideas, topics, or themes” (paraphrased)

^ covers 4.B and 6.B

An example school history lesson:

1. Remember the specific parts of the Parliamentary Acts (e.g., the Sugar, Stamp, and Townshend Acts); 
2. Explain the consequences of the Parliamentary Acts for different colonial groups;  3. Choose a colonial character or group and write a persuasive editorial stating his/her/its position on the Acts (the editorial must include at least one supporting reason not specifically taught or covered in the class); and  4. Self- and peer edit the editorial. 

1. Covers 1.A
2. Covers 2.B
3. Covers 6.A and 6.B
4. Covers 5.B

We can see: 

- no C (procedural knowledge) and no D (metacognitive) :(
- Mainly focussed on higher-order cognitive processes :)
- Objective 3 targets higher orders than Objective 4, tasks could be planned in a different order :(

METACOGNITION: IMPLICATIONS FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT
===

Metacognitive aspects should be *embedded* in learning, though they can be taught separately (e.g. ‘learning to learn’ courses).

Overwhelmingly, adult students have very little metacognitive understanding in a learning context, often because they were never given opportunities to engage with it in a learning context

High metacognitive ability is directly linked to self-sufficient and lifelong learners, and high learning motivation.

To increase metacognitive aspects of curriculum lessons, be explicit about use of learning strategies (rather than *implicit*, which most teaching is):

- Explicitly model learning strategies i.e. by talking aloud while modelling a solution, explaining the processes you use
- encourage discussion of why you use particular strategies as the ‘expert’ in any scenario
- encourage students to explicitly share which strategies they would use, using consistent terminology
- informally assess metacognitive knowledge by actively listening to why students choose particular strategies to learn something, in the same way as you usually assess content knowledge
- encourage students to reflect on metacognitive aspects of their learning, rather than solely content
