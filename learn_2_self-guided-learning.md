Learn Faster, Harder, Stronger II: Self-guided learning
===

##The Kinds of Knowledge (*Knowledge Dimension*)


4 different ‘kinds’ of knowledge - e.g. terminology, specific skills, self-knowledge.

NOT exclusive to the ‘remember’ stage of cognitive process taxonomy (you can ‘analyse’ self-knowledge, for example)

A. Factual Knowledge - The basic elements that students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.   Aa. Knowledge of terminology 
  Ab. Knowledge of specific details and elements 
B. Conceptual Knowledge - The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.   Ba. Knowledge of classifications and categories 
  Bb. Knowledge of principles and generalizations 
  Bc. Knowledge of theories, models, and structures 
C. Procedural Knowledge - How to do something; methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.   Ca. Knowledge of subject-specific skills and algorithms   Cb. Knowledge of subject-specific techniques and 
methods   Cc. Knowledge of criteria for determining when 
to use appropriate procedures 
D. Metacognitive Knowledge - Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.   Da. Strategic knowledge 
  Db. Knowledge about cognitive tasks, including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge 
  Dc. Self-knowledge 

D is most important for self-guided learning (especially adult learning)

SCAFFOLDING SELF-GUIDED LEARNING USING BLOOM'S TAXONOMY
===

Knowledge Dimension D (metacognition, 1979) is the most important for self-guided learning:

D. Metacognitive Knowledge - Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.   Da. Knowledge of useful learning strategies
  Db. Knowledge of when is the right context to apply them, and why
  Dc. Knowledge of which strategies work best for you & what motivates you best

Supported by cognitive science, information processing, neuroscience, educational theory etc.

Da. Learning Strategies
===

- Rehearsal (repeating words to yourself, ‘rote learning’: not suitable for lower-level cognitive processes (1. and some 2.))
- Elaboration (mnemonics, summarizing, paraphrasing, identifying the main ideas, teaching an idea to another, translating, analogising: suitable for all levels of cognitive processes)
- Organisation (outlining, concept-mapping, graphing, note-taking in a style unique to you, diagramming, creating aide-memoirs, planning essays, etc, suitable for higher-level cognitive processes (2. and up))
- Metacognitive (e.g. setting subgoals, monitoring cognition by asking questions & checking answers against rubrics, re-reading things you get wrong, moving up and down the taxonomy depending on what you can and cannot do)
- Modelling (working backwards from a solution, avoiding circularity and fallacy in logical thinking, inferring from multiple sources of data, using appropriate resources)

Db. Knowing the right context
===

Evaluate a task using the taxonomy - am I being asked to remember, explain, analyse…? and selecting the right strategy from the above (and any others)

Also applying strategies appropriate to the cultural context - working in a team on an analysis problem may first involve definition of that problem using Modelling, where a single student might be able to jump straight to Organising the solution

Dc. Knowing what works for you
===

Knowing:

- What your strengths and weaknesses are in the taxonomy
- What your strengths and weaknesses are in tasks
- Whether you over-rely on one or more learning strategies and so are inflexible when others are called for (e.g. you’re great at Organising information on your own but suck at clarifying problems in a team, see above).

And adjusting your own use of learning strategies/practicing tasks or taxonomic levels to adapt.

Also knowing how your own motivation varies depending on:

- The taxonomic level (i.e. ‘I suck at explaining things but can remember almost everything’)
- The task in question (i.e. ‘I hate working in a team but am way awesome on my own’)
- The domain of study (i.e. ‘I love politics but really struggle with math concepts’)
- The learning strategy being used (i.e. ‘I hate taking notes, I love diagramming everything instead’)

Again, adjusting your own use of learning strategies to increase your motivation, and practicing different approaches to certain tasks so as to maintain high motivation.
