Learn Faster, Harder, and Stronger I: Introducing Bloom's Taxonomy
===

> This is a series of articles aimed at both students and educators. In three parts, we look at how Bloom's Taxonomy (1956, revised 2001) can be used to build stronger, more motivated learners and clearer, more robust curricula. In this first article, we're going to introduce the Taxonomy. To get the most out of articles 2 and 3, it's vital that we're familiar with the theory behind the practices.

###What's Bloom's Taxonomy?
[Bloom's Taxonomy](http://www.casact.org/admissions/syllabus/Blooms-Taxonomy.pdf) is a powerful way of modelling the complexity of cognitive tasks. It was originally developed across several US universities from 1949 to 1956, and is generally considered to be one of the most, if not the most, important models in educational theory. It has been translated into 22 languages, and forms the backbone of almost all formal curricula around the world.

In 2001 Anderson and Krathwohl [revised](http://rt3region7.ncdpi.wikispaces.net/file/view/8+Perspectives+on+RBT.pdf) the language and structure of Bloom's Taxonomy to better reflect the language used by educators, to provide more powerful tools for analysing and building curricula, and to bring the taxonomy in line with modern scientific advances in cognitive science.

Bloom's Taxonomy divides the process of learning a topic into 'stages', each more complex (or 'cognitively demanding') than the last:

- 1. Knowledge (the ability to recall or remember something)
- 2. Comprehension (the ability to understand or explain something)
- 3. Application (the ability to use topic knowledge)
- 4. Analysis (the ability to break down topic knowledge and derive new insights)
- 5. Synthesis (the ability to create something original using topic knowledge)
- 6. Evaluation (the ability to judge or esteem others' topic knowledge as worthy or not)

Bloom's Taxonomy asserts that proficiency in 'simpler' cognitive processes are prerequisites to mastery of more complex ones. It also asserts that you have to do one step after the other: you can't 'skip' or 'jump' straight from recalling what happens when you multiply two numbers together to critiquing someone's PhD about Abelian multiplication.

###Why is Bloom's Taxonomy worth knowing?

From the original 1956 publication, Bloom's Taxonomy provides:

- a “common language about learning goals”, which allows educators and educators, educators and learners, and learners and learners to communicate about teaching and learning in a consistent way;
- a “basis for determining…the specific meaning of broad educational goals”, enabling swifter and more robust construction of curricula, as well as better self-guided learning;
- a homogenised approach to tracking progress throughout a certain topic ('domain'), as learners can clearly identify 'where they are' in the topic-learning process, and
- Clearer indication of where a particular learning experience sits within the educational possibilities of a topic as a whole.

###Where is Bloom's Taxonomy used?

One of the big insights the Taxonomy offered was that, overwhelmingly, planned curricula focus on Knowledge (fact recognition and recall) at the expense of the real goals: Comprehension (understanding) and Synthesis (the creation of new things). Bloom's Taxonomy can be used by large educational bodies to upgrade unbalanced (Knowledge-centric) and inefficient (particularly repetitive) curricula to ones that 'scaffold' (i.e. guide) learners to higher cognitive tasks. Likewise, Bloom's Taxonomy can be used by individual learners to:

- Figure out 'how good' you are at a particular topic (am I in the 'Knowledge' category, or do I qualify for 'Comprehension'?);
- Scaffold self-guided learning so you can enhance your abilities in a topic area without requiring instruction, and
- Aspire to higher levels of cognitive ability in a topic area in a structured way.

There are several tools, like [Taxonomy Tables](http://www.etc.edu.cn/eet/articles/bloomrev/chart2.jpg) that are widely used to boost efficiency in learning. Less time spent dawdling around recalling facts and rote-learning basics, and more time spent debating and discussing topics in action or building projects, makes for far more efficient learning. Likewise, attempting to do higher-level tasks without knowing or comprehending the basics of a topic causes confusion, upset, and a drastic decrease in motivation. The most efficient learning scaffolds are those that make use of Bloom's Taxonomy.

##Revision

The 1956 version of Bloom's Taxonomy is a very powerful tool. On the other hand, it is antiquated. Educators and learners rarely use terms like 'Comprehension' in the way Bloom's Taxonomy does. In fact, 

Curricula are split up into ‘learning objectives’, usually a verb and a noun. E.g. ‘students should be able to *remember* (verb) *the law of supply and demand*(noun)’, or ‘learners will *understand*(verb) *the importance of pair programming in a team environment*(noun)’

Main problem is *most* learning objectives and instructors use ‘understand’ and actually mean anything from Comprehension to Synthesis

Revision formalised the *verb* aspect of learning objectives:

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

Learning objectives can and should use this taxonomy to be clear about the order students should learn things (as the taxonomy is broadly linear).

Revision also formalised the “Knowledge Dimension” - different forms of the *noun* element - and added ‘metacognition’ as a kind of knowledge.

Revision further taxonomised these 6 levels into sublevels*

KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE (“Knowledge Dimension”) 2001
===
4 different ‘kinds’ of knowledge - e.g. terminology, specific skills, self-knowledge.

NOT exclusive to the ‘remember’ stage of cognitive process taxonomy (you can ‘analyse’ self-knowledge, for example)

A. Factual Knowledge - The basic elements that students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.   Aa. Knowledge of terminology 
  Ab. Knowledge of specific details and elements 
B. Conceptual Knowledge - The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.   Ba. Knowledge of classifications and categories 
  Bb. Knowledge of principles and generalizations 
  Bc. Knowledge of theories, models, and structures 
C. Procedural Knowledge - How to do something; methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.   Ca. Knowledge of subject-specific skills and algorithms   Cb. Knowledge of subject-specific techniques and 
methods   Cc. Knowledge of criteria for determining when 
to use appropriate procedures 
D. Metacognitive Knowledge - Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one's own cognition.   Da. Strategic knowledge 
  Db. Knowledge about cognitive tasks, including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge 
  Dc. Self-knowledge 

D is most important for self-guided learning (especially adult learning)

SUBCATEGORIES
===

Each category is broken into subcategories, which are also linear

2001 revision uses verbs (gerunds) to define these, e.g.:

1.0 Remember
   1.1 Recognizing
   1.2 Recalling

These should ideally be observed when trying to scaffold learning, but there is some overlap (e.g. 2.7 Explaining is a more complex cognitive skill than 3.1 Executing)

*Structure of the Revised Taxonomy 
===
1.0 Remember - Retrieving relevant knowledge from long-term memory.   1.1 Recognizing   1.2 Recalling 
2.0 Understand - Determining the meaning of instructional messages, including oral, written, and graphic communication. 
  2.1 Interpreting 
  2.2 Exemplifying 
  2.3 Classifying 
  2.4 Summarizing 
  2.5 Inferring 
  2.6 Comparing 
  2.7 Explaining 
3.0 Apply - Carrying out or using a procedure in a given situation. 
  3.1 Executing   3.2 Implementing 
4.0 Analyze - Breaking material into its constituent parts and detecting how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose.   4.1 Differentiating 
  4.2 Organizing 
  4.3 Attributing 
5.0 Evaluate - Making judgments based on criteria and standards. 
  5.1 Checking 
  5.2 Critiquing 
6.0 Create - Putting elements together to form a novel, coherent whole or make an original product.   6.1 Generating   6.2 Planning 
  6.3 Producing
